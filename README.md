Chart for periodic wave solutions is attached. 

The code for finding wave length of Stokes wave for given T, h, and H are can be found here: https://github.com/KuifengZhao/stokesWave/blob/main/StokesDispSolver.m 

The code for how Le Mehaute's chart was updated is included on 27 Dec --> Code4UpdateChart.m
